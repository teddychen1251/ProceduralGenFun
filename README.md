# Procedural Content Generation Fun
This is a collection of Procedular Content Generators that I made for class in Unity. There are three types of content: dungeons, trees, and hermit crabs.
To generate a certain type, enable the generator in the inspector and click 'Play'. Each generator has settings, such as seed, that you can play around with.
